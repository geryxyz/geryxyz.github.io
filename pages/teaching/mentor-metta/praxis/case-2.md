## Description

Two students on the same team—one quiet, the other talkative but prone to distraction—could not choose a representative and kept redirecting responsibility toward each other, despite contributing well when they genuinely engaged. To illustrate what the role required, I briefly role-played as a representative from another team, making clear that my style was only one possibility, not a prescription. After class, I stayed with them to describe *observable* behaviors using “this is what I see,” reminding them that I cannot read intentions—silence may stem from shyness, distraction from a rough day. I explained that their team still must function collectively and offered concrete suggestions, such as avoiding phone use and voicing ideas even before they are polished. I also shared, as a personal and non-binding opinion, who I thought might fit the representative role and why. Importantly, I only stayed because I had the emotional and practical capacity to do so; if I hadn’t, I would have invited them to a scheduled **“office hour”** instead, since a rushed or frustrated presence would undermine the safe atmosphere quiet students especially need. Throughout the conversation, I avoided shielding them from natural consequences like deadlines or lost points—these are part of the learning environment—but I did not blame them either. My aim was not judgment but support, using grades simply as a tool to mirror real-world accountability rather than as punishment. I left feeling the extra time was well spent because it helped them grow rather than feeding urgency or frustration.

## Practical Tips for Tutors

1. **Only stay for extra guidance when you can offer calm, unhurried presence; otherwise schedule a dedicated “office hour.”**
   A pressured or frustrated mood suppresses student openness—especially for quieter students—so protect the environment before you protect the schedule.

2. **Give clear, non-interpretive feedback and invite initiative rather than assigning blame.**
   Describe what you *observed*, acknowledge that behavior may have many causes, and offer concrete actions (e.g., no phone use, speak early and imperfectly) to help the team function.

3. **Let natural consequences stand, but frame them as learning tools rather than punishments.**
   Deadlines, lost points, or slower progress should educate, not shame—your goal is to help them grow, with grading serving as an analogy to real project responsibilities.
