## Description

In a C++ assignment involving `vector`, a student incorrectly supplied two template parameters—treating it as though it were a two-type container like `map`. While my colleague was frustrated, I saw the mistake differently: the student’s reasoning wasn’t entirely wrong. They understood that the task required bundling two types, but misapplied the concept and, more importantly, submitted the code without ever trying it out. This layered mistake shows that learning is fundamentally **communication**—students construct meaning from what we say, and sometimes the meaning they construct diverges from what we intended. That divergence is not only their error; it is also pedagogical feedback for us. Tutors are not perfect interpreters nor perfect explainers, and when a student’s misunderstanding surfaces, it may reflect gaps in our scaffolding, our examples, or how clearly we framed the assignment. This is not self-blame but professional humility: staying open to the idea that we too must refine our didactic craft. So yes, the student must learn to test their work and choose appropriate data structures, and I will explicitly remind them of that. **If they ignore the reminders and continue submitting untested work, that is ultimately their choice and the natural grade consequences belong to them—not to the tutor, who gains nothing from frustration.** Meanwhile, our task is to use such moments to strengthen both the student’s understanding and our own teaching, recognizing that every mistake is part of a shared learning loop where communication continually improves.

## Practical Tips for Tutors

1. **Treat every misunderstanding as a communication signal, not a failure.**
   When a student misuses a concept (like applying the wrong container type), assume it may reflect how they interpreted your explanation—and use it as feedback to refine your examples, wording, or scaffolding.

2. **Acknowledge that tutors are fallible and grow through student errors.**
   Instead of feeling frustrated, see mistakes as invitations to improve your pedagogical clarity. Staying open to this possibility is not self-blame but professional development grounded in humility and compassion.

3. **Let consequences teach while you stay emotionally steady.**
   Remind students to test their work and explain the risks of not doing so, but remember: **If they ignore the reminders and continue submitting untested work, that is ultimately their choice and the natural grade consequences belong to them—not to the tutor, who gains nothing from frustration.**
